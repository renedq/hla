                <p>HLA epitope based matching is a challenging new concept in compatibility testing for transplantation and transfusion. This conference addressed basic concepts of HLA epitopes including antigenicity and immunogenicity as well as the interpretation of antibody reactivity patterns with HLA panels in different assays.  There was a focus on the determination of HLA epitope specificities of serum antibodies and its relevance in assessing HLA mismatch acceptability for sensitized patients and a better understanding of humoral immune responses to HLA class I, class II and MICA mismatches.  </p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>HLAMatchmaker is an algorithm to predict HLA epitopes by molecular structural modeling and amino acid sequence comparisons between HLA alleles.  It considers each HLA allele as a series of small configurations of polymorphic residues referred to as eplets as essential components of HLA epitopes. The website-based International Registry of HLA Epitopes (<a href="http://www.epregistry.com.br" target=_blank>http://www.epregistry.com.br</a>) describes the repertoires of HLA-ABC, -DRDQDP and -MICA eplets. An important question is which eplets correspond to actual epitopes specifically recognized by HLA antibodies.</p> 
            <p>Recent publications describe antibody-verified epitopes recorded so far in the HLA Epitope Registry. All of them correspond to eplets and there are two patterns.  First, a specific antibody reacts with all alleles carrying a given eplet whereas the remaining alleles in the panel are non-reactive. In these cases, an eplet describes the epitope specifically recognized by antibody. Second, an epitope is defined by the combination of an eplet and another polymorphic residue configuration (eplet) uniquely shared between all antibody-reactive alleles. Such epitopes are described by so-called eplet pairs. The repertoires of antibody-verified epitopes must be considered incomplete.</p>
            <p>This new Excel program has been designed to analyze HLA antibody reactivity patterns with single allele panels. Reactive alleles carry epitopes which are studied in two steps. First, we determine the presence of antibody-verified epitopes (eplets and eplet pairs) that are mismatched for the antibody producer. Second, we determine if other reactive alleles in the panel have additional epitopes which have not (yet) been antibody-verified in the HLA Epitope Registry.  The updated antibody analysis version has features that permit a quick assessment of epitope specificities and the interpretation of allele mismatch acceptability. </p>

You can enter any number but we believe that a proper cut-off value must be based on the MFI values for the self-alleles of the antibody producer; such values reflect true non-reactivity.   Any other allele in the SAB panel with a MFI more than three standard deviations above the mean value with self can be statistically considered as being significantly higher.  Accordingly we can determine the cut-off value by rounding to the nearest 100 above.<br>
                        You can see in column G that each allele of the antibody producer of Case #217 had an extremely low MFI value and we determined a cut-off value of 100.</td>

Moreover, the program removes all the epitopes expressed by the negative alleles from the entire panel. The reactive alleles show the remaining epitopes. You will see that most of them have small numbers of antibody-verified epitopes.<br> 
                        We must raise the question which of these epitopes would be specifically recognized by serum antibodies.  Information about the immunizing event will offer an answer. Case #217 was a post-pregnancy serum and the paternal haplotype of the child was recorded on the entry sheet.</td>

Column H indicates which allele in the panel belongs to the immunizer so you can see which ones had induced antibodies.  The last step of this analysis is to determine which epitopes of the immunizer are specifically recognized by the antibodies. This requires a distinction between “immunizer-specific” and “third-party” epitopes.</td>

The immunizing B*07:02 has 65QIA,70IAQ,163EW and 180E and you may note that the 163EW carrying HLA-C alleles have very low MFI values suggesting that the 163EW-defined epitope needs another configuration shared between HLA-B and A*66:02 (note that A*66:01 has a much lower MFI value). The immunizing A*03:01 has 161D and one or two epitopes that correspond with antibody-verified pairs. Several weakly reacting alleles share 45EE with the immunizing B*07:02, this epitope has not (yet) been antibody-verified. You may also note that a group of HLA-B alleles with very low MFI values share a third-party 44RT epitope.  Although the clinical significance of low MFI values might be considered questionable it is interesting to note that some of them may reflect weakly reacting epitope-specific antibodies. <br>
                        The major purpose of serum analysis for specific antibodies is the determination mismatch acceptability of donor alleles.  This HLAMatchmaker program makes this determination</td>

Row 5 has a filter command to select alleles with certain numbers of mismatched epitopes.  Depending on the determination of the cut-off value in the Luminex test and the interpretation which epitope is clinically important, the program can readily determine which alleles are acceptable mismatches.</td>

For this case the cut-off values was determined at 700 and the each reactive allele shows a list of epitopes that are mismatched for the antibody producer.
